# Theory of Organizational Knowledge Creation

## **Introduction**

Studies have shown the importance of organizational values, meanings, commitments, symbols and beliefs, and recognized that the organization as a shared meaning system, can learn, change itself, and evolve over time. However, these studies have not paid enough attention to the potential and creativity of human beings. The human being is seen as an information processor, rather than an information creator. A major target for research in organizations today is to understand how organizations acquire new products, new methods of manufacture and marketing, and new organizational forms. Understanding how organizations create new knowledge that makes such creations possible is a more fundamental need now.

## **Knowledge**

Business organizations process and create knowledge. Knowledge is a function of a particular stance, perspective, or intention. It is anchored in the beliefs and commitment of its holder. Knowledge is essentially related to action and is always “to some end.”

## **Eastern Knowledge vs Western Knowledge**
| Eastern | Western |
|----|----|
| Oneness of humanity and nature – Think visually and manipulate tangible images, Time as a continuous flow of “present” | Cartesian Split– Subject (the knower) and Object (the known); Mind and body/matter/nature |
| Oneness of body and mind– Wisdom is acquired from the perspective of the entire personality. Knowledge is integrated into one’s personal character | Opposing traditions– Rationalism (True knowledge is not the product of sensory experience but some ideal mental process) and Empiricism (The only source of knowledge is sensory experience) |
| Oneness of self and other– Exist among others harmoniously as a collective self; You and I are two parts of a whole |    |

## **Explicit and Tacit Knowledge**

The basic building blocks in a complementary continuous dynamic interaction/conversion are:

* **Explicit knowledge**: formal language including grammatical statements, mathematical expressions, specifications, manuals etc.
* **Tacit knowledge**: involves intangible factors such as personal belief, perspective and the value system. It is personal knowledge rooted in individual experience.

         o   Not easily visible and expressible

         o   Highly personal and hard to formalize, making it difficult to communicate and share with others

         o   Subjective insights, intuitions, and hunches

         o   Deeply rooted in individual action and experience, ideals, values and emotions.


Explicit knowledge can be processed by computer, but the subjective and intuitive nature of tacit knowledge makes it difficult to process in any systematic or logical manner. This is a major distinction between explicit and tacit knowledge.

For tacit knowledge to be communicated and shared within an organization, it has to be converted into words and numbers that anyone can understand. During this time of conversion, from tacit to explicit, and back again into tacit, organizational knowledge is created.

## **Dimensions of Tacit Knowledge**

* **The technical dimension**: contains the kind of informal and hard-to-pin-down skills or crafts captured in the term “know-how.” A master craftsman is often unable to articulate what he knows.
* **The cognitive dimension**: consists of schemata (cognitive schemes), mental models, beliefs, and perceptions so ingrained that we take them for granted. It reflects our image of reality (what is and ought to be)

## **Implications of Tacit knowledge**

* Whole different view of the organization– Organization as a living organism rather than a machine for processing information.

* Whole different view of innovation– highly individual process of personal and organizational self-renewal rather than a putting together of diverse information. Ideals not ideas. The essence of innovation is to re-create the world in accordance with a specific ideal or vision.

* Whole different view of knowledge– less formal i.e. metaphors, pictures, experiences, mental and physical transitions instead of acquiring, teaching, training.

## **Knowledge Conversion**

Knowledge conversion is the social interaction between tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge to create and expand knowledge. Westerners tend to emphasize explicit knowledge, Japanese tend to stress implicit, but tacit and explicit are mutually complementary entities. They interact with and interchange into each other in the creative activities of human beings.

There are five phases to knowledge creation – sharing tacit knowledge, creating concepts, justifying concepts, building an archetype and cross-leveling of knowledge. Enabling conditions are intention, autonomy, fluctuation & creative chaos, redundancy and requisite variety

## **Modes of knowledge conversion**

Four modes of knowledge conversion are socialization, externalization, combination and internalization.
